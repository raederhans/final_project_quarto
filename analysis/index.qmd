# Analysis 

Philadelphia have being well known for its unsafety, crime and chaos at especially the northern part.
But we do want to question, does crime affect all people? or some races and disadvantaged groups will suffer more.
This project hence tries to investigate the relationship between house prices, crime rate and race distribution across Philadelphia.
Which particularly, it ended up find out the crime attack all people and all regions equally, but disadvantaged groups do more likely to be affected.
Yet, it also highlights the crime need more social indicators other than property features to investigate their distributions.
